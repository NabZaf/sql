# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
Saving the address should require customer consent. 

Does not retain changes - Type 1

Retains Changes in address Type2

```

```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
1.	The AdventureWorks Schema has far more tables and far more relationships. Each table is also in greater detail.
2.	The AdvenureWorks schema does not whether the relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many.
If I had more time, I would make my diagram in more detail. I would think about what I need in the tables to better understand customer preferences and to build a better relationship with my customers. Of course, One needs to keep data privacy and other ethical issues in mind.
