**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my learnings from the Knowledge Management courses at the Faculty of Information and my prior experience with data, I’ve come to understand the paramount importance of incorporating ethical and inequity considerations throughout the data lifecycle.
At the outset, during data collection, it’s crucial to respect privacy and consent norms, which not only upholds ethical standards but also enhances data accuracy. Following this, in the representation of data, it’s essential to ensure fair representation of diverse groups to avoid any biases or disparities.
Privacy is another key aspect, where access to data should be limited to only those who need it, thereby safeguarding sensitive information. When it comes to usage, it’s advisable to refrain from collecting unnecessary personal data and to maintain transparency about the data being collected and its intended use.
Moreover, conducting regular audits is an ongoing commitment that ensures compliance with ethical procedures and standards. These steps are just a few among many to ensure the integration of ethics and inequity components when working with data.
As we progress into an era where data accessibility is increasing and AI is advancing, these considerations become even more critical to ensure ethical and equitable data practices.
